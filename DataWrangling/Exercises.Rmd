## Part 1

Use the following data for this part:

```{r}
library(gapminder)
gap_data <- gapminder
```

+ Filter the data for the Americas in 2007. Retain only the `lifeExp` variable and deselect all other variables.
+ Create the variable `gdp`, defined as the product of `pop`  and `gdpPercap`.
+ Identify the observation (combination of county, continent, and year) with lowest gdp per person.
+ Identify all observations with above average life expectancy, stratified for each continent.
+ Compute the mean life expectancy for each year per continent.
